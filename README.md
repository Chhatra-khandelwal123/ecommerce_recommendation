# 🛍️ Product Recommendation System for E-commerce (Walmart Dataset)
This project is a machine learning-based recommendation system built on an e-commerce dataset (Walmart.com). It predicts and suggests products to users using multiple techniques like:

- ⭐ Rating-based Recommendation
- 🔎 Content-based Filtering
- 👥 Collaborative Filtering
- ⚡ Hybrid Recommendation System

The system also features an interactive Streamlit app for easy use and visualization.

📦 Features

⭐ Rating-based Recommendations
This method identifies trending products by analyzing user ratings and review counts. It calculates the average rating for each product and prioritizes those with higher ratings and more reviews, ensuring that popular and well-received products are recommended.

🔎 Content-based Recommendations
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), this approach recommends products based on their content features, like descriptions, tags, and categories. By measuring the semantic similarity of product content using techniques like TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, the system suggests products with similar attributes to what the user is interested in.

👥 Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering recommends products by analyzing user behavior. It identifies users with similar tastes and suggests products that those users liked but the target user hasn't interacted with yet. This approach relies on user-item interaction data and similarity measures like Cosine Similarity.

⚡ Hybrid Recommendations
The hybrid system combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to improve accuracy. By integrating both methods, it offers more relevant and diverse recommendations, overcoming limitations like cold start problems and enhancing personalization and semantic relevance.

🛠️ Tools Used
🐍 Python 3.x
Python is the core programming language for this project, offering a rich ecosystem of libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn that make it ideal for data science and machine learning. Its simplicity and flexibility allow for rapid development of the recommendation system.

🚀 Streamlit
Streamlit powers the interactive web interface of this project, enabling users to easily explore product recommendations in real-time. It simplifies the process of turning Python scripts into engaging web applications, providing a seamless user experience.

📊 Pandas
Pandas handles the heavy lifting of data manipulation and cleaning. It allows us to quickly preprocess, filter, and transform the dataset into the format needed for analysis, making the entire process more efficient and organized.

🔢 Numpy
Numpy is the engine behind all numerical operations in the project. It helps manage and process large datasets with its fast array operations, ensuring optimal performance during the matrix calculations and computations that power the recommendation algorithms.

🧠 Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is the go-to library for implementing machine learning algorithms. From calculating cosine similarity to creating TF-IDF vectors, it provides all the tools needed for content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, helping to build accurate product recommendations.

💬 SpaCy
SpaCy enables powerful text processing capabilities, transforming raw product descriptions into useful features. By extracting key terms and analyzing semantic similarity, SpaCy plays a critical role in the content-based recommendation engine.

📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn
These visualization libraries allow us to create detailed charts, graphs, and heatmaps. With Matplotlib's flexibility and Seaborn's aesthetic styling, they provide insightful visuals for exploring data patterns and results, enhancing the data exploration process.

🧮 Scipy
Scipy offers advanced algorithms for scientific and technical computing. It is particularly useful for sparse matrix operations and efficient similarity calculations, speeding up the key computations that drive both content-based and collaborative filtering recommendations.
