# 🛍️ Product Recommendation System for E-commerce (Walmart Dataset)
This project is a machine learning-based recommendation system built on an e-commerce dataset (Walmart.com). It predicts and suggests products to users using multiple techniques like:

- ⭐ Rating-based Recommendation
- 🔎 Content-based Filtering
- 👥 Collaborative Filtering
- ⚡ Hybrid Recommendation System

The system also features an interactive Streamlit app for easy use and visualization.

📦 Features

⭐ Rating-based Recommendations
This method identifies trending products by analyzing user ratings and review counts. It calculates the average rating for each product and prioritizes those with higher ratings and more reviews, ensuring that popular and well-received products are recommended.

🔎 Content-based Recommendations
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), this approach recommends products based on their content features, like descriptions, tags, and categories. By measuring the semantic similarity of product content using techniques like TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, the system suggests products with similar attributes to what the user is interested in.

👥 Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering recommends products by analyzing user behavior. It identifies users with similar tastes and suggests products that those users liked but the target user hasn't interacted with yet. This approach relies on user-item interaction data and similarity measures like Cosine Similarity.

⚡ Hybrid Recommendations
The hybrid system combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to improve accuracy. By integrating both methods, it offers more relevant and diverse recommendations, overcoming limitations like cold start problems and enhancing personalization and semantic relevance.


🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3.x
The core programming language for developing the recommendation system, providing flexibility and efficiency for implementing machine learning algorithms.

Streamlit
A powerful framework used to create the interactive web application for easy exploration of product recommendations. It allows for fast prototyping and data visualization.

Pandas
A library used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps in cleaning, transforming, and structuring data efficiently, especially for handling large datasets.

Numpy
Provides support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices. It's essential for numerical operations, helping speed up the computation process.

Scikit-learn
A key machine learning library that offers various algorithms for data analysis. In this project, it’s used for implementing TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and other machine learning techniques like clustering and recommendation.

SpaCy
A robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) library used to process and clean textual data. It helps extract features from product descriptions and reviews for content-based filtering.

Matplotlib & Seaborn
Used for data visualization. These libraries help create charts, graphs, and heatmaps to explore and visualize patterns in the data, such as user ratings and product similarities.

Scipy
A library used for scientific and technical computing, especially useful for sparse matrix operations and computing cosine similarities efficiently in large datasets.
